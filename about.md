# About 

This is the open-source "fork", sort of, to [the original Reddit post](https://reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/ztdtll/an_organized_collection_of_selene_da_silvas_clips/) which was made to organize the clips of voice teacher [Selene Da Silva](https://clyp.it/user/tgqiml4a) (since the platform [clyp.it](https://clyp.it) does not allow convenient viewing of a user's full list of works). Some older clips of Selene's will not be found here due to them being considerably out-of-date with the teacher's current practices. If you really want to see those regardless, they're available at the very bottom of her Clyp profile (after a lot of scrolling).
  
If you're new to this model of voice, it's a great idea to read [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/ztdtll/comment/jf5j55w/) and listen to the clips linked there before continuing to the full post. The comment provides important context and will help you navigate this resource more efficiently. Please ignore the sidebar on r/transvoice, by the way, as it is extremely outdated.
