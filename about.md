# About the site

This is the open-source "fork", sort of, to [the original Reddit post](https://reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/ztdtll/an_organized_collection_of_selene_da_silvas_clips/) which was made to organize the clips of voice teacher [Selene Da Silva](https://clyp.it/user/tgqiml4a) (since the platform [clyp.it](https://clyp.it) does not allow convenient viewing of a user's full list of works). Some older clips of Selene's will not be found here due to them being considerably out-of-date with the teacher's current practices. If you really want to see those regardless, they're available at the very bottom of her Clyp profile (after a lot of scrolling).
