# How to contribute to the project

The simplest form of contribution would be just adding another clip to the appropriate section in this format:  
```* [clip name](clyp.it link)```  
where you basically just place another hyperlinked bullet point under (or between) the rest. This is pretty easy, and all you need to do is make sure there's no dupes and that the clips align's with Selene's to-date teaching standards (which is why many of her older clips aren't here; they feature techniques she no longer approves of).

The other thing you can do is mess around with the arrangement of the clips (as in, say, putting a clip somewhere else or completely changing how things are categorized, just make sure to discuss big changes with the community beforehand), or make changes to the text contents in the post. This can be improving explanations or adding your own useful announcements or clarifications in there if you consider that necessary. If certain clips become incredibly dated, I wouldn't blame you if you removed them or added a little note right next to them.

Basically, try to live by the philosophy of making the resource functional, up-to-date, and friendly both to beginners and advanced learners. When in doubt, talk to the smart folks over on [Online Vocal Coach](https://discord.gg/acjy4Cw9z3).
