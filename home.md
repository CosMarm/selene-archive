# An organized collection of Selene Da Silva's clips

If you're new to this model of voice, it's a great idea to read [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/ztdtll/comment/jf5j55w/) and listen to the clips linked there before continuing to the full post. The comment provides important context and will help you navigate this resource more efficiently. Please ignore the sidebar on r/transvoice, by the way, as it is extremely outdated.

The links here cover the most important vocal features (namely, *size*, *weight*, *fullness*, and *personality*). Everything outside this category is entirely optional.

Focus on hearing and identifying the shifts first before attempting to mimic. Listening is the first step.

<ul>
    {% include clip.html name="Size v2" clyp_id="jdquw5ac" %}
    {% include clip.html name="Weight" clyp_id="nwreza0c" %}
    {% include clip.html name="Fullness" clyp_id="hu53kin0" %}
    {% include clip.html name="Personality-implying features vs body-implying features" clyp_id="hfxzbuw0" %}
    {% include clip.html name="Personality-implying features vs body-implying features vol. 2" clyp_id="av422l1p" %}
</ul>

More information on each of these can be found in their respective sections if needed. 

Below are lists of clips separated by topic. There is lot of them, so keep in mind that you aren't expected to listen to every single one. You're also not expected to immediately understand all the theory, and this is where listening to more clips can be helpful.
