# An organized collection of Selene Da Silva's clips

The links here cover the most important vocal features (namely, *size*, *weight*, *fullness*, and *personality*). Everything outside this category is entirely optional.

Focus on hearing and identifying the shifts first before attempting to mimic. Listening is the first step.
