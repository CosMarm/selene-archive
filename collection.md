# An organized collection of Selene Da Silva's clips

This is the open-source "fork", sort of, to [the original Reddit post](https://reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/ztdtll/an_organized_collection_of_selene_da_silvas_clips/). This archive was made to organize the clips of voice teacher [Selene Da Silva](https://clyp.it/user/tgqiml4a) since the platform [clyp.it](https://clyp.it) does not allow convenient viewing of a user's full list of works. Some older clips of Selene's will not be found here due to them being considerably out-of-date with the teacher's current practices. If you really want to see those regardless, they're available at the very bottom of her Clyp profile (after a lot of scrolling).
  
If you're new to this model of voice, it's a very good idea to read [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/ztdtll/comment/jf5j55w/) and listen to the clips linked there before continuing to the full post. The comment provides important context and will help you navigate this resource more efficiently. Please ignore the sidebar on r/transvoice, by the way, as it is extremely outdated.

**Some background info:**

**The perceptual model (also known as the size/weight model or the Gestalt Voice Model) was developed by [Clover Grigsby](https://www.clovergrigsby.com/) and [Zheanna Erose](https://linktr.ee/zheanna), who are part of [TransVoiceLessons](https://www.transvoicelessons.com/).**  
**[Selene Da Silva](https://clyp.it/user/tgqiml4a) is the founder of [Vox Nova](https://voxnovastudio.com/), and works alongside Clover and Zheanna as an instructor for TVL's group courses.**

**You can find the TVL YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/transvoicelessons), and you can find Selene and Clover's server [here](https://discord.gg/acjy4Cw9z3).**

Remember that you're not actually supposed to listen to every single clip in this post. Aside from the essentials below, you're completely free in regards to the clips you choose. Go at your own pace and don't feel like you have to rush things or understand all the material immediately.

# **Essentials (start here)**

The links here cover the most important vocal features (namely, *size*, *weight*, *fullness*, and *personality*). Everything outside this category is entirely optional.

Focus on hearing and identifying the shifts first before attempting to mimic. Listening is the first step.

# **Weight**

Vocal weight is separate from pitch, and it can be thought of as a spectrum of roughness and softness. Loudness is also correlated with weight, but it's possible (and quite useful) to be loud yet light (or low yet heavy).

# **Fullness**

'Fullness' is essentially the balance of size and weight; the closer they are to each other, the more typical and "full" the sound is. Large size and heavy weight go together, while small size and light weight go together. If the size and weight aren't in balance, one's voice may sound atypical and/or cartoony.

The clips below cover theory and explorations across the range of fullness.

# **Personality**

Below are demonstrations on 'personality-expressing features', which are responsible for communicating one's gender expression (among other social traits) independently of their physiology. This is part of how you can get feminine male voices and masculine female voices; it's just a matter of tuning body feautures and personality features.
