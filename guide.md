# A crash course on vocal transitioning

The goal of vocal training is to alter the degree of *expressed androgenic development* of the voice. This includes:

* **Pitch + [Weight](https://clyp.it/nwreza0c)** -- Tackling these separately is incredibly difficult and frankly a bit of a non-starter. Pay attention to how pitch influences the weight (or buzz) in the voice. If you are aiming to increase the expressed androgenic development of the voice, get heavier. If you are aiming to decrease the expressed androgenic development of the voice, get lighter.
* **[Size](https://clyp.it/jdquw5ac), to [Fullness](https://clyp.it/hu53kin0)** -- Size is the impression of how large or small the speaker sounds. Larger voices tend to convey a greater degree of expressed androgenic development; smaller voices do the opposite. If size and weight are not commensurate with one another, the resulting sound will sound atypical; seeking a **balance between size and weight (fullness)** is crucial to the overall process of voice training, regardless of your vocal target.

This will result in two basic combinations of **full** sounds: *heavy and large*, or *small and light*. You should now be expressing the degree of androgenic development you're aiming for.

People seeking androgynous voices: early on, you will likely want to aim as far as possible in the direction of transition (or perhaps this is better stated as *away from your current default*) before settling on something more to your liking.

With the perceived androgenization of the voice resolved, we now look to major changes that impact our perception of a speaker's *performed gender*:

* **[Pronunciation](https://clyp.it/ixugho3v)**, on a spectrum from *sharp* to *dull*. In general, masculine speakers exhibit duller pronunciation, and feminine speakers exhibit sharper pronunciation.

These are the features I consider to be absolutely core. Most people will achieve a sound that gets them gendered correctly by focusing on the above features. If you're seeking more things to incorporate, some other personality-expressing features to investigate would include:

* **[Prosody](https://clyp.it/5ye4trqx)**, which includes not just pitch displacement, but the [fluidity vs angularity](https://clyp.it/i2sczsjr) of pitch change, as well as **Rhythm**, which is comprised of the overall pace or tempo of speech and **Spacing** (whether and how much silence there is between individual words), and **Stress**, which we vary through elongation or by varying weight.

* Delving further into **accent**, we can identify some of the specific features of regional masculine and feminine accents by identifying changes in [vowel shift](https://clyp.it/fa2b4j11), [vowel replacement](https://clyp.it/brl0hhc2), and [vowel stress and precision](https://clyp.it/dqpornlz).

If you can do all of that without running into issues with efficiency, stability, connection, kn√∂del (like Kermit the frog), or tongue obstruction (as exemplified by the characters Stitch or Elmo), then you've pretty much identified all the features of the voice that matter in any vocal endeavor.

A short formula expressing a typical **masculine** voice:

* heavy weight + moderate to low pitch, 
* larger size aiming for fullness, 
* duller pronunciation, with more angular pitch contour, higher degree of spacing, and more abrupt shifts in rhythm, that utilizes heavier weight for emphasis and stress.

A short formula expressing a typical **feminine** voice: 

* light weight + moderate to high pitch, 
* smaller size aiming for fullness, 
* sharper pronunciation, with more fluid pitch contour, a minimal degree of spacing or high degree of connection from one word to another, with gradual but large changes in rhythm utilizing elongation and increases in pitch for emphasis and stress.
